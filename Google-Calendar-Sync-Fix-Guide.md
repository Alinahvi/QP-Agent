# Google Calendar Sync Fix Guide

## Problem Description

The call scheduler is working correctly and creating both Task (call) and Event (calendar) records in Salesforce, but these events are not appearing in Google Calendar. This is a common issue with Salesforce calendar integration.

## Root Cause

Salesforce calendar events (Event objects) do not automatically sync to Google Calendar unless:
1. **Salesforce's built-in Google Calendar sync is enabled** (requires admin setup), OR
2. **Custom Google Calendar integration is implemented** (requires API setup)

## Solutions

### Solution 1: Enable Salesforce's Built-in Google Calendar Sync (Recommended)

This is the easiest solution and requires admin setup in Salesforce:

#### Step 1: Enable User Permissions
1. Go to **Setup → Users → Profile → System Administrator**
2. Enable **"Google Calendar Sync"** permission
3. Save the profile

#### Step 2: Enable Org-wide Google Workspace Integration
1. Go to **Setup → Integrations → Google Workspace**
2. Click **"Enable Google Workspace"**
3. Follow the OAuth setup process
4. Enable **"Calendar Sync"** option

#### Step 3: Configure User-level Sync
1. Go to **Setup → Users → Users**
2. Select your user (anahvi@salesforce.com)
3. Click **"Edit"**
4. Enable **"Google Calendar Sync"**
5. Choose sync direction (Salesforce → Google, Google → Salesforce, or Both)

### Solution 2: Use Custom Google Calendar Integration (Already Implemented)

I've updated the call scheduler to automatically create Google Calendar events using the existing integration setup.

#### What Was Added:
- **Google Calendar event creation** in `ANAgentCallSchedulerService.cls`
- **Automatic attendee management** with proper response statuses
- **Error handling** for when Google Calendar integration is unavailable
- **Enhanced response** including Google Calendar event ID

#### How It Works:
1. Call scheduler creates Salesforce Task and Event records
2. Automatically attempts to create Google Calendar event
3. Sends invitations to all participants
4. Returns Google Calendar event ID if successful

#### Requirements:
- **Named Credential**: `Google_Event` must be configured
- **Google Calendar API access** must be enabled
- **Proper OAuth setup** for Google Workspace

### Solution 3: Manual Google Calendar Sync

If neither automated solution works, you can manually sync events:

1. **Export Salesforce events** to CSV
2. **Import to Google Calendar** using Google's import feature
3. **Set up recurring sync** using third-party tools like Zapier

## Testing the Updated Call Scheduler

I've created a test script at `scripts/apex/test_updated_call_scheduler.apex` that you can run to verify the updated functionality.

### Expected Output:
```
=== CALL SCHEDULER TEST RESULTS ===
Success: true
Message: Call scheduled successfully! Google Calendar event created.
Call ID: 00TD700000aELf9MAG
Call URL: /lightning/r/Task/00TD700000aELf9MAG/view
Event ID: 00UD7000009Lim5MAC
Event URL: /lightning/r/Event/00UD7000009Lim5MAC/view
Google Calendar Event ID: [Google Calendar Event ID]
Request ID: null
✅ Call scheduled successfully!
✅ Google Calendar event created with ID: [ID]
```

## Troubleshooting

### If Google Calendar Events Still Don't Appear:

1. **Check Named Credential**:
   - Go to **Setup → Security → Named Credentials**
   - Verify `Google_Event` exists and is properly configured

2. **Check API Permissions**:
   - Ensure Google Calendar API is enabled in Google Cloud Console
   - Verify OAuth scopes include calendar access

3. **Check User Permissions**:
   - Ensure your user has access to the Google Calendar being used
   - Verify the calendar ID in the integration settings

4. **Check Debug Logs**:
   - Run the test script with debug logging enabled
   - Look for Google Calendar API errors in the logs

### Common Error Messages:

- **"Google Calendar integration not available"**: Named credential missing or misconfigured
- **"Google Calendar API error: 401"**: Authentication/authorization issue
- **"Google Calendar API error: 403"**: Insufficient permissions
- **"Google Calendar API error: 404"**: Calendar not found

## Next Steps

1. **Try Solution 1** (Salesforce built-in sync) - easiest and most reliable
2. **If that doesn't work**, the updated call scheduler should automatically create Google Calendar events
3. **Test with the provided script** to verify functionality
4. **Check debug logs** for any integration errors

## Support

If you continue to experience issues:
1. Check the debug logs for specific error messages
2. Verify Google Workspace integration is properly configured
3. Ensure all required permissions are enabled
4. Contact your Salesforce admin for integration setup assistance

**Note**: The updated call scheduler will gracefully handle cases where Google Calendar integration is unavailable, so it won't break existing functionality even if Google Calendar sync fails.
