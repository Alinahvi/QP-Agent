Archived Kits and Legacy Docs

This folder contains legacy kits and tickets that have been applied to the codebase. They are preserved here for reference.

Contents

- mcp_fanout_kit — Parallel fanout kit (discovery/planning/tickets). Live implementations exist under src/tools/orchestrator*.ts and server registration.
- planning_upgrade_no_git_delta — Original no‑git delta from the planning upgrade; live changes are already applied.
- planning_upgrade_tickets — Original planning/tickets backlog that informed the implementation.

Notes

- For current capabilities and usage, see the repo root README.md and AGENTS.md.
- Do not modify files here to change behavior; update the live code under src/tools instead.
