- **`ANAgentAETerritoryAnalysisBatch`** - Handles large datasets (>50k records)

### Data Source
- **`AGENT_OU_PIPELINE_V2__c`** - Flat data structure containing all AE territory information

## Topic Configuration

### 1. Add Handler to Topic
Add `ANAgentAETerritoryAnalysisHandler` to your QP-Agent topic configuration.

### 2. Available Actions
The system supports the following analysis types:

#### **OPEN_PIPELINE_STATUS**
- Analyzes opportunities across all 5 pipeline stages
- Shows ACV, AE health scores, and aging by stage
- Identifies top products and accounts per stage

#### **PIPELINE_GENERATION_OPPORTUNITIES**
- **Off-sell**: Existing customer expansion opportunities
- **Cross-sell**: New product opportunities for existing customers  
- **Renewals**: Contract renewal opportunities with values

#### **TERRITORY_KPIS**
- Current vs previous quarter performance comparison
- Pipeline generation, ACV, meetings, calls, create & close metrics
- Trend analysis (UP/DOWN/STABLE)

#### **NEW_HIRE_ANALYSIS**
- Configurable time windows (3, 6, or 12 months)
- Days to productivity and ACV participation
- Ramp status distribution and peer comparisons

#### **COMPREHENSIVE_ANALYSIS**
- Combines all analysis types for complete territory insights
- Best for executive summaries and strategic planning

## Filtering Options

- **Sample Results**: First N results (configurable, default: 10)
- **CSV Available**: Notification if CSV export was requested

### CSV Export
- **All Records**: Complete dataset for detailed analysis
- **Formatted**: Proper CSV structure with headers
- **Filename**: Timestamped for easy identification

## Advanced Features

### Batch Processing
- Automatically handles datasets >50k records
- Progress tracking via Apex Jobs
- Email notifications upon completion

### Smart Filtering
- Field mapping between user-friendly names and API names
- Intelligent query building with proper escaping
- Support for partial matches and wildcards

### Performance Optimization
- Efficient SOQL queries with minimal field selection
- Batch processing for large datasets
- Configurable result limits

## Error Handling

### Validation Errors
- Invalid analysis types are rejected with clear messages
- Parameter validation (e.g., new hire months 1-60)
- Required field validation

### Data Errors
- Graceful handling of missing or null data
- Detailed error logging for debugging
- User-friendly error messages

## Best Practices

### Query Optimization
1. **Use Specific Filters**: Narrow down results for better performance
2. **Limit Results**: Use maxResults parameter to control chat output
3. **CSV for Large Datasets**: Enable CSV export for detailed analysis

### User Experience
1. **Clear Instructions**: Guide users on available analysis types
2. **Progressive Disclosure**: Show summary first, then detailed results
3. **CSV Integration**: Provide data for external analysis tools

### Performance
1. **Batch Processing**: Automatically handles large datasets
2. **Efficient Queries**: Minimal field selection and smart filtering
3. **Result Limiting**: Configurable limits to prevent timeouts

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### "No Results Found"
- Check filter parameters (OU, vertical, country)
- Verify data exists in AGENT_OU_PIPELINE_V2__c
- Try broader filters or different analysis types

#### "Batch Processing Required"
- Dataset exceeds 50k records
- Check Apex Jobs for progress
- Monitor email notifications for completion

#### "Invalid Analysis Type"
- Use only supported types from getAvailableAnalysisTypes()
- Check spelling and case sensitivity
- Refer to sample queries for guidance

### Debug Information
- Use `getFieldMappingInfo()` for field reference
- Check `getSupportedFilters()` for valid options
- Review `getAnalysisCapabilities()` for feature overview

## Integration Examples

### With Other ANAgents
```apex
// Example: Combine with Content Search for enablement
"Show me new hire performance and recommend relevant training courses"

// Example: Integrate with APM Nomination
"Analyze territory performance and identify APM nomination candidates"
```

### With External Systems
- CSV export for BI tools (Tableau, Power BI)
- Data integration with HR systems
- Performance reporting dashboards
