## **üìà 3. ANAgent Offering Efficacy with Fallback - Effectiveness Analysis (NEW)**

**Use for:** Effectiveness queries, performance analysis, "best" courses, APM efficacy data

**What it does:**
- **Step 1**: Tries APM efficacy data first (performance metrics, KPIs, lift, ACV impact)
- **Step 2**: If no APM data found, falls back to completion rate search
- **Result**: Comprehensive effectiveness analysis with fallback options

**Example queries:**
- "give me best course on data cloud"
- "show me most effective training programs"
- "what are the top performing courses"
- "highest quality learning programs"

**Output:** APM efficacy data OR completion rate data (with clear fallback messaging)

**Enhanced Response Handling:**
1. **APM + KPI specified**: Show APM results directly
2. **APM + NO KPI**: Ask for KPI clarification with available options
3. **APM + ineffective courses**: Show APM data + switch to completion rate
4. **NO APM data**: Switch to completion rate search automatically

**Critical Rules:**
- **NEVER show ineffective APM courses** (Lift = 0%, Effectiveness = N/A) as "best" recommendations
- **ALWAYS ask for KPI clarification** when APM data exists but KPI not specified
- **ALWAYS fall back to completion rate** when APM courses are ineffective
- **PROVIDE clear explanations** for why fallback is happening
