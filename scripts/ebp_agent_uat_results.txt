Issues Found: 2 minor issues
Recommendations: 3 optimization recommendations

FINAL SUMMARY:
=============
✅ ALL AGENT ACTIONS WORKING CORRECTLY
- ABAGENT Future Pipeline Analysis: ✅ Working (CPU optimization needed)
- ANAgentKPIsAnalysis: ✅ Working (Excellent performance)
- ANAGENT Open Pipe Analysis V3: ✅ Working (Excellent performance)
- ANAgent Search Content: ✅ Working (Good performance)
- ANAgent Search SMEs: ✅ Working (Excellent performance)

ISSUES IDENTIFIED:
=================
1. CPU Usage: ABAGENT Future Pipeline Analysis uses 74% of CPU limit
2. Logging Issue: SME Search response too long for logging field (255 char limit)

RECOMMENDATIONS:
===============
1. Optimize ABAGENT Future Pipeline Analysis for better CPU efficiency
2. Implement response truncation for logging in SME Search
3. Consider batch processing for large datasets in Future Pipeline Analysis
