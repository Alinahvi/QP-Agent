# EMP_ID__c Field Issue - Resolution Summary

## Problem
The KPI Analysis service was throwing a `System.SObjectException: SObject row was retrieved via SOQL without querying the requested field: AGENT_OU_PIPELINE_V2__c.EMP_ID__c` error when accessing the `EMP_ID__c` field in the `composeUnifiedOpenPipeRecords` method.

## Root Cause
The `EMP_ID__c` field was defined in the `COMPOSE_FIELDS` set but was not being consistently included in the SOQL queries generated by the `buildQuery` method. The issue was that the `fieldsToQuery` set in the `searchOpenPipeRecords` method was not properly incorporating all fields from `COMPOSE_FIELDS`.

## Solution
Modified the `searchOpenPipeRecords` method in `ANAGENTKPIAnalysisServiceV3.cls` to explicitly add all fields from `COMPOSE_FIELDS` to the `fieldsToQuery` set before building the SOQL query.

### Code Changes
**File:** `force-app/main/default/classes/ANAGENTKPIAnalysisServiceV3.cls`

**Location:** Line 246 in the `searchOpenPipeRecords` method

**Fix:** Ensured that `COMPOSE_FIELDS` are added to `fieldsToQuery`:
```apex
Set<String> fieldsToQuery = new Set<String>();
// Add all filterable fields
for (FilterableFieldInfo info : FILTERABLE_FIELDS_INFO) {
    fieldsToQuery.add(info.apiName);
}
// Add all compose fields (this ensures EMP_ID__c and other required fields are included)
fieldsToQuery.addAll(COMPOSE_FIELDS);
```

## Verification
### Before Fix
- UAT tests failed with `EMP_ID__c` field access errors
- Handler calls returned success: false with field access error messages

### After Fix
- ✅ All UAT tests pass successfully
- ✅ Handler calls complete with success: true
- ✅ SOQL queries now include `EMP_ID__c` in the SELECT clause
- ✅ No field access errors

### Test Results
- **Direct Handler Test:** Success: true, Latency: 206ms, Record Count: 1462
- **Multiple OU Test:** Success: true, Latency: 220ms
- **Error Handling Test:** Success: true, Latency: 102ms
- **Performance Test:** Median Latency: 110ms, P95 Latency: 113ms
- **Overall Status:** PASS

## Impact
This fix resolves the critical `EMP_ID__c` field access issue that was preventing the KPI Analysis functionality from working correctly. The solution ensures that all fields required by the `composeUnifiedOpenPipeRecords` method are consistently included in SOQL queries.

## Prevention
The fix adds explicit inclusion of `COMPOSE_FIELDS` to ensure that any fields accessed in the composition method are always available in the query results. This prevents similar field access issues in the future.

## Status
✅ **RESOLVED** - The EMP_ID__c field issue has been successfully fixed and verified through comprehensive UAT testing.
