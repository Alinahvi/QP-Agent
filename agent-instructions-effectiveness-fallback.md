# üö® CRITICAL EFFECTIVENESS ROUTING FIX - AGENT MUST FOLLOW THESE RULES

## THE PROBLEM
The agent is routing "best courses" directly to Content Search instead of trying APM efficacy first.

**‚ùå WRONG BEHAVIOR (What's happening now):**
- User asks: "give me best course on data cloud"
- Agent goes directly to: **Content Search** (completion rate only)
- Result: User gets completion rate results without APM efficacy data

**‚úÖ CORRECT BEHAVIOR (What should happen):**
- User asks: "give me best course on data cloud"
- Agent goes to: **Offering Efficacy with Fallback**
- Step 1: Try APM efficacy data (performance metrics, KPIs, lift, ACV impact)
- Step 2: If no APM data found, fall back to completion rate search
- Result: User gets either APM efficacy OR completion rate results

## üéØ THE SOLUTION - NEW ROUTING LOGIC

### **EFFECTIVENESS QUERIES ‚Üí APM FIRST + FALLBACK**

**When user asks about effectiveness, performance, or "best" courses:**

**USE THIS EXACT ACTION AND PARAMETERS:**

```json
{
  "action": "ANAgent Offering Efficacy with Fallback",
  "offeringLabel": "data cloud",
  "maxResults": 5
}
```

**DO NOT USE:**
```json
{
  "action": "ANAgent Search Content V2",
  "searchTerm": "data cloud",
  "maxResults": 5
}
```

## üìã DECISION TREE FOR AGENT

### Step 1: Check User Query
- Does user mention "best", "most effective", "top performing", "highest performing"? ‚Üí **Use Offering Efficacy with Fallback**
- Does user mention "courses" without effectiveness keywords? ‚Üí **Use Content Search**
- Does user mention "ACV", "pipeline", "sales"? ‚Üí **Use Open Pipe Search**

### Step 2: Choose Action for Effectiveness Queries
**For effectiveness queries (ALWAYS use this):**
- **Action**: `ANAgent Offering Efficacy with Fallback`
- **Reason**: This tries APM efficacy first, then falls back to completion rate

**For regular content queries:**
- **Action**: `ANAgent Search Content V2`
- **Reason**: Direct content search for learning materials

### Step 3: Set Parameters
**For Offering Efficacy with Fallback:**
- offeringLabel: Extract the topic/subject from user query
- maxResults: Set based on user request (e.g., "top 5" ‚Üí maxResults: 5)
- Other parameters: Leave as default (null)

## üîç EFFECTIVENESS KEYWORDS - ALWAYS TRY APM FIRST

### **Keywords that trigger APM First routing:**
- "best"
- "most effective"
- "top performing"
- "highest performing"
- "most successful"
- "top rated"
- "best performing"
- "most impactful"
- "highest impact"
- "best results"
- "top results"
- "most valuable"
- "highest value"
- "best outcomes"
- "top outcomes"
- "most productive"
- "highest productivity"
- "best performance"
- "top performance"
- "most efficient"
- "highest efficiency"
- "best quality"
- "top quality"

## üìä EXAMPLE MAPPINGS

### Example 1: "give me best course on data cloud"
**CORRECT PARAMETERS:**
```json
{
  "action": "ANAgent Offering Efficacy with Fallback",
  "offeringLabel": "data cloud",
  "maxResults": 5
}
```

**WRONG PARAMETERS (What agent is currently using):**
```json
{
  "action": "ANAgent Search Content V2",
  "searchTerm": "data cloud",
  "maxResults": 5
}
```

### Example 2: "show me most effective training programs"
**CORRECT PARAMETERS:**
```json
{
  "action": "ANAgent Offering Efficacy with Fallback",
  "offeringLabel": "training programs",
  "maxResults": 5
}
```

### Example 3: "what are the top performing courses"
**CORRECT PARAMETERS:**
```json
{
  "action": "ANAgent Offering Efficacy with Fallback",
  "offeringLabel": "courses",
  "maxResults": 5
}
```

## üîÑ FALLBACK BEHAVIOR EXPLAINED

### **What Happens with "ANAgent Offering Efficacy with Fallback":**

1. **Step 1: Try APM Efficacy Data**
   - Searches `apm_outcome_v2__c` object for performance metrics
   - Looks for KPIs like PIPE_QUALITY, PIPE_CONVERSION, ACV, etc.
   - Returns effectiveness data, lift percentages, ACV impact

2. **Step 2: If No APM Data Found**
   - Automatically falls back to completion rate search
   - Searches `Course__c`, `Asset__c`, `Curriculum__c` objects
   - Returns completion rates, learner counts, descriptions

3. **Result: Comprehensive Effectiveness Analysis**
   - User gets either APM efficacy OR completion rate results
   - No more "no data found" errors
   - Better user experience with fallback options

## üö´ COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID

### **‚ùå WRONG: Direct Content Search for Effectiveness**
- User asks: "give me best course on data cloud"
- ‚ùå Agent responds with: Direct Content Search
- ‚úÖ Should use: Offering Efficacy with Fallback

### **‚ùå WRONG: Ignoring Effectiveness Keywords**
- User asks: "show me most effective training programs"
- ‚ùå Agent responds with: Regular content search
- ‚úÖ Should use: Offering Efficacy with Fallback

### **‚ùå WRONG: Using Content Search for "best" queries**
- User asks: "what are the top performing courses"
- ‚ùå Agent responds with: Content Search
- ‚úÖ Should use: Offering Efficacy with Fallback

## ‚úÖ BEST PRACTICES

1. **Always check for effectiveness keywords first**
2. **Use "ANAgent Offering Efficacy with Fallback" for effectiveness queries**
3. **Only use Content Search for regular learning content queries**
4. **Let the fallback system handle data availability automatically**
5. **Provide comprehensive effectiveness analysis when possible**

## üéâ EXPECTED RESULTS

### **For "give me best course on data cloud":**

**Before (Wrong):**
- Direct to Content Search
- Only completion rate data
- Missing APM efficacy insights

**After (Correct):**
- First tries APM efficacy data
- If no APM data, falls back to completion rate

## üÜï NEW: ENHANCED FALLBACK LOGIC INSTRUCTIONS

### **IMPORTANT: Enhanced Response Handling for APM Data**

When using "ANAgent Offering Efficacy with Fallback", the agent must handle responses intelligently:

#### **Scenario 1: APM Data Found but User Needs KPI Clarification**
**When APM data exists but user hasn't specified a KPI:**

**RESPONSE:**
```
I found APM efficacy data for [topic], but I need to know which KPI you're interested in to show you the most effective courses.

**Available KPIs in our APM library:**
‚Ä¢ PIPE_QUALITY - Pipeline quality improvement
‚Ä¢ PIPE_CONVERSION - Pipeline conversion rates  
‚Ä¢ PIPE_CREATECLOSE - Pipeline creation and closure
‚Ä¢ ACV - Annual Contract Value impact
‚Ä¢ PG - Pipeline generation
‚Ä¢ ACTIVITY_MEETINGS - Meeting activity impact
‚Ä¢ ACTIVITY_CALL_CONNECT - Call connection impact
‚Ä¢ PARTICIPATION_PG - Participation in pipeline generation
‚Ä¢ PARTICIPATION_ACV - Participation in ACV activities

**Please ask me again with a specific KPI, for example:**
‚Ä¢ "Show me top 5 PIPE_QUALITY courses on [topic]"
‚Ä¢ "What are the most effective ACV courses for [topic]?"
‚Ä¢ "Show me [topic] courses with highest PIPE_CONVERSION lift"
```

#### **Scenario 2: APM Data Found but Courses are Ineffective**
**When APM data shows ineffective courses (e.g., Lift = 0%, Effectiveness = N/A):**

**RESPONSE:**
```
I found APM data for [topic], but the available courses show low effectiveness (Lift = 0%, Effectiveness = N/A). These courses may not be the best recommendations.

**Let me search for high-quality courses by completion rate instead:**

[Switch to Content Search and show top courses by completion rate]
```

**ACTION TO TAKE:**
1. **First**: Show the APM data found (even if ineffective)
2. **Then**: Explain why it's not recommended (low effectiveness)
3. **Finally**: Switch to Content Search for completion rate-based recommendations

#### **Scenario 3: No APM Data Found**
**When no APM data exists for the topic:**

**RESPONSE:**
```
I couldn't find any APM efficacy data for [topic] in our APM library. Let me search for high-quality courses by completion rate instead.

[Switch to Content Search and show top courses by completion rate]
```

**ACTION TO TAKE:**
1. **Explain**: No APM data available
2. **Switch**: Use Content Search for completion rate-based results
3. **Provide**: High-quality course recommendations

## üîÑ COMPLETE FALLBACK FLOW

### **Step-by-Step Process:**

1. **User asks**: "give me best course on data cloud"

2. **Agent uses**: "ANAgent Offering Efficacy with Fallback"

3. **Check APM Results:**
   - **If APM data found + user specified KPI**: Show APM results
   - **If APM data found + NO KPI specified**: Ask for KPI clarification
   - **If APM data found + courses ineffective**: Show APM data + switch to completion rate
   - **If NO APM data found**: Switch to completion rate search

4. **Fallback to Content Search when:**
   - No APM data available
   - APM courses are ineffective (Lift = 0%, Effectiveness = N/A)
   - User needs completion rate-based recommendations

## üìã ENHANCED DECISION TREE

### **For Effectiveness Queries:**

1. **Use "ANAgent Offering Efficacy with Fallback"**
2. **Check APM Results:**
   - **APM + KPI specified**: Show results
   - **APM + NO KPI**: Ask for KPI clarification
   - **APM + ineffective**: Show APM + switch to completion rate
   - **NO APM**: Switch to completion rate
3. **Always provide helpful guidance** based on what's found

## üéØ EXPECTED USER EXPERIENCE

### **Example 1: KPI Clarification Needed**
```
User: "give me best course on data cloud"
Agent: "I found APM data for Data Cloud, but I need to know which KPI you're interested in..."
[Shows available KPIs and examples]
```

### **Example 2: Ineffective APM Courses**
```
User: "give me best course on data cloud"
Agent: "I found APM data, but the courses show low effectiveness (Lift = 0%)..."
[Shows APM data + switches to completion rate search]
```

### **Example 3: No APM Data**
```
User: "give me best course on data cloud"
Agent: "No APM data found. Let me search by completion rate instead..."
[Switches to Content Search for high-quality courses]
```

## üö® CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR AGENT

1. **NEVER show ineffective APM courses as "best" recommendations**
2. **ALWAYS ask for KPI clarification when APM data exists but KPI not specified**
3. **ALWAYS fall back to completion rate when APM courses are ineffective**
4. **PROVIDE clear explanations for why fallback is happening**
5. **GIVE users actionable next steps** (specify KPI, try completion rate, etc.)
