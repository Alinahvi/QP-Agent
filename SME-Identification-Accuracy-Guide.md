# SME Identification Accuracy Guide

## üö® CRITICAL: SME Identification Criteria

### **ACTUAL SME Identification Criteria (From System)**

SMEs are identified based on **ONLY** these criteria from the `sme_prime_ae__c` object:

1. **AE_RANK__c** - Account Executive rank (lower numbers = higher rank)
2. **TOTAL_ACV__c** - Total Annual Contract Value (higher values = better performance)
3. **PRODUCT_L3__c** - Product category (Level 3)
4. **PRODUCT_L2__c** - Product category (Level 2)
5. **OU__c** - Operating Unit

### **Ranking Order**
```sql
ORDER BY AE_RANK__c ASC, TOTAL_ACV__c DESC
```

## ‚ùå **NEVER MENTION THESE MADE-UP CRITERIA**

The following criteria are **NOT** used for SME identification and should **NEVER** be mentioned:

- ‚ùå Customer testimonials
- ‚ùå Peer recommendations
- ‚ùå Awards and achievements
- ‚ùå Training and certifications
- ‚ùå Years of experience
- ‚ùå Customer satisfaction scores
- ‚ùå Performance metrics beyond ACV
- ‚ùå Sales targets
- ‚ùå Industry expertise
- ‚ùå Client feedback
- ‚ùå Recognition programs
- ‚ùå Any other criteria not in the actual system

## ‚úÖ **CORRECT RESPONSES**

### Example 1: "How are SMEs identified?"
**‚úÖ CORRECT:**
"SMEs (Subject Matter Experts) are identified based on their performance in the system using these criteria:
- AE Rank (lower numbers indicate higher rank)
- Total Annual Contract Value (ACV) - higher values indicate better performance
- Product expertise in specific categories (Product L2 and L3)
- Operating Unit

The system ranks SMEs by AE Rank first (ascending), then by Total ACV (descending)."

### Example 2: "What criteria are used for SME selection?"
**‚úÖ CORRECT:**
"The SME identification system uses these specific criteria:
1. AE_RANK__c - Account Executive rank
2. TOTAL_ACV__c - Total Annual Contract Value
3. PRODUCT_L3__c and PRODUCT_L2__c - Product categories
4. OU__c - Operating Unit

SMEs are ranked by AE Rank (ascending) then by Total ACV (descending)."

## ‚ùå **INCORRECT RESPONSES**

### Example 1: "How are SMEs identified?"
**‚ùå WRONG:**
"SMEs are identified based on customer testimonials, peer recommendations, awards, certifications, years of experience, and customer satisfaction scores."

### Example 2: "What criteria are used for SME selection?"
**‚ùå WRONG:**
"SMEs are selected based on their expertise, performance, and experience in specific product areas. Common criteria include:
- Annual Contract Value (ACV)
- Sales Targets
- Years of Experience
- Product Knowledge
- Peer Recognition
- Awards and Achievements
- Training and Certifications
- Customer Feedback
- Client Testimonials
- Customer Satisfaction Scores"

## üîç **WHEN TO SEARCH KNOWLEDGE BASE**

**ALWAYS search the knowledge base when users ask about:**
- How SMEs are identified
- What criteria are used for SME selection
- How the SME ranking system works
- SME identification process
- SME selection criteria

**Use these search terms:**
- "SME identification"
- "SME criteria"

## üìã **VALIDATION CHECKLIST**

Before answering any SME-related question:

- [ ] Have I searched the knowledge base?
- [ ] Am I only using information from the system?
- [ ] Am I mentioning the correct fields (AE_RANK__c, TOTAL_ACV__c, etc.)?
- [ ] Am I avoiding made-up criteria?
- [ ] Am I being truthful about the ranking order?

## üö® **EMERGENCY STOP**

If you're about to mention any of these, **STOP IMMEDIATELY**:
- Customer testimonials
- Peer recommendations
- Awards
- Certifications
- Years of experience
- Customer satisfaction
- Any criteria not in the system

**Instead:**
1. Search the knowledge base

## üìù **RESPONSE TEMPLATE**

When asked about SME identification:

1. **Search the knowledge base first**
