## ❌ **Failed Test Cases (1/56)**

### **Single Failure: Country-based Query**
**Failed Case:**
- "Which product has the highest amount of upsell and cross-sell opportunity in the USA?"

**Root Cause:** The MCP server requires an Operating Unit (OU) for future pipeline generation, but this query only specifies a country (USA) without an OU.

**Error Message:** "Operating Unit (ouName) is required for pipeline generation. Please specify an OU like 'AMER ACC' or 'EMEA ENTR'."

## 🔧 **MCP Server Performance**
