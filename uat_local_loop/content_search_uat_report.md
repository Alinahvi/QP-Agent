### **Root Cause Analysis**

1. **Marketing Cloud Recognition**: The MCP server doesn't recognize "Marketing Cloud" as a valid topic
2. **Context Loss**: Some utterances like "For those courses, show enrollments" lose context from previous queries
3. **Generic Queries**: Queries without specific topics fail the topic extraction logic

## 🔧 **MCP Server Performance**

### **Response Times**
- **Average MCP Response**: 2.8ms
- **Fastest Response**: 1.9ms
- **Slowest Response**: 10.1ms

- **Source Detection**: 100% (ACT/Consensus)
- **Topic Extraction**: 100% for recognized topics

## 📈 **Success Patterns**

### **High Success Rate Patterns**
1. **Explicit Topic Mention**: "Data Cloud", "Sales Cloud", "Service Cloud"
2. **ACT + Topic**: "ACT courses related to [Topic]"
3. **Consensus + Topic**: "Consensus demo on [Topic]"
4. **Specific Filters**: Completion rates, enrollment numbers, date ranges
