# [ARCHIVED] MCP: Robust Discovery + Planning Entry Points (No-Git)

Status: Applied. Live implementations exist in `src/tools/entrypoints.ts` and are registered in `src/server.ts`. Use those tools (planning:status/resume, discovery:start_from_object/start_from_lwc, docs:scan) rather than this kit. See `AGENTS.md` and root `README.md` for current usage.
