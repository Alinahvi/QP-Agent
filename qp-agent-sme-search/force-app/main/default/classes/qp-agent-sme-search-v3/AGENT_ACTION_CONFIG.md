### Step 5: Output Instructions

Copy and paste this into the **Output Instructions** field:

```
The response contains a comprehensive, formatted message with SME search results.

## Response Structure

The message includes the following sections:

1. **Summary** - Search parameters and result counts
2. **Insights** - Key statistics (top OU, academy member percentage)
3. **SME Details** - Individual SME information with:
   - Name and organizational unit
   - Product expertise (L2 and L3)
   - AE ranking score
   - Total ACV (Annual Contract Value)
   - Academy membership status
   - Relevance score and scoring explanation
4. **Limits & Counts** - Total matches and truncation info
5. **Data (JSON)** - Structured data for further processing

## How to Present Results

When presenting SME search results to the user:

‚úÖ **DO:**
- Present SME names prominently
- Highlight their organizational unit
- Mention their product expertise
- Indicate if they are academy members
- Note their ranking/relevance to the query
- If results are limited, mention total count (e.g., "Found 710 SMEs, showing top 5")
- Use natural language, not technical jargon

‚ùå **DON'T:**
- Don't show raw JSON to users
- Don't expose technical field names (like AE_RANK__c)
- Don't show relevance scores unless user asks
- Don't show all details if user only wants names

## Example Presentation

**Good Response:**
"I found 5 Tableau SMEs in UKI for you:

1. **John Doe** (UKI) - Tableau CRM expert, Academy Member ‚≠ê
2. **Jane Smith** (UKI) - Tableau Analytics specialist
3. **Bob Johnson** (UKI) - Tableau & Einstein expert, Academy Member ‚≠ê
4. **Sarah Williams** (UKI) - Tableau CRM
5. **Mike Brown** (UKI) - Tableau

There are 710 total Tableau SMEs in UKI - I'm showing you the top 5 ranked by expertise and relevance. Would you like me to search for more specific criteria?"

**Note:** The search found a total of 710 matches. Would you like me to narrow down the search with additional filters?

## Handling Edge Cases

**No results found:**
- "I couldn't find any SMEs matching '[searchTerm]' [in OU if specified]. Would you like me to try a broader search or different criteria?"

**Many results (truncated):**
- "I found [total] SMEs for [searchTerm], showing you the top [maxResults] by relevance. Would you like to see more or filter by region?"

**Academy members:**
- Indicate academy status with context: "John Doe is a Salesforce Academy member, indicating certified expertise"
```

### Step 6: Advanced Settings (Optional)

**Timeout:** 30 seconds (default is fine)

**Error Handling:**

User: "Find Tableau SMEs"
Agent uses:
  searchTerm = "Tableau"
  searchType = "product"
  maxResults = 10 (default)
```

### Pattern 2: Filtered by Region
```

Agent uses:
  searchTerm = "Data Cloud"
  searchType = "product"
  ouName = "UKI"
  maxResults = 10 (default)
```

```
User: "Find academy members for MuleSoft"
Agent uses:
  searchTerm = "MuleSoft"
  searchType = "product"
  academyMembersOnly = true
  maxResults = 10 (default)
```

### Pattern 4: Limited Results
```

  searchTerm = "Sales Cloud"
  searchType = "product"
  maxResults = 3
```
