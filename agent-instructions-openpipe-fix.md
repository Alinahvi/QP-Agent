# OpenPipe Opportunity Search - Enhanced Agent Instructions

## üö® CRITICAL FORECAST TYPE FIX

### The Problem:
The agent was using `PipeGen_ACV` which does not exist, causing "no opportunities found" errors.

### The Solution:
Use the correct forecast type names:
- ‚úÖ **OpenPipe_ACV** (for ACV opportunities)
- ‚úÖ **PipeGen** (for pipe generation opportunities)
- ‚ùå **PipeGen_ACV** (DOES NOT EXIST - causes errors)
