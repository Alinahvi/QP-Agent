   - Basic grouping, filtering, and aggregation capabilities

2. **Data Sources**
   - `Agent_Renewals__c` - Renewal opportunities
   - `Agent_Cross_Sell__c` - Cross-sell opportunities  
   - `Agent_Upsell__c` - Upsell opportunities

3. **Basic Field Mapping**
   - Product fields mapped correctly
   - Account fields mapped correctly
   - AE and OU fields mapped correctly

- `AE_Score__c` - AE performance score
- `Coverage__c` - AE quota coverage
- `Amount__c` - Upsell opportunity value
- `PRODUCT_L2__c` - Product category level 2
- `PRODUCT_L3__c` - Product category level 3

## 2. **Intelligence Feature Gaps**

### **Renewal Risk Analysis**
- **Current State**: No renewal risk scoring

- **Impact**: Cannot identify top performers or underperformers

### **Product-Market Fit (PMF) Analysis**
- **Current State**: Basic product grouping
- **Gap**: No efficiency scoring or market fit analysis
- **Impact**: Cannot identify best-performing products or segments

### **Pipeline Health Scoring**
- **Current State**: No health metrics
- **Gap**: No composite health score or trend analysis
- **Impact**: Cannot assess overall pipeline health

## 3. **Business Logic Gaps**

### **Renewal Analysis Gaps**
- No renewal probability calculation
- No time-to-renewal analysis
- No renewal risk factors identification
- No renewal amount forecasting

### **Cross-Sell Analysis Gaps**
- No cross-sell opportunity scoring
- No product affinity analysis
- No cross-sell success rate tracking
- No cross-sell timing optimization

### **Upsell Analysis Gaps**
- No upsell opportunity scoring
- No expansion potential analysis
- No upsell success rate tracking
- No upsell timing optimization

## 4. **Data Quality & Volume Gaps**

### **Data Availability Issues**
- Limited test data for comprehensive analysis
- Missing field values affecting calculations
- Inconsistent data formats across objects

### **Data Relationships**
- No relationships between renewal, cross-sell, and upsell opportunities
- No customer journey mapping
- No opportunity sequencing analysis

## 5. **User Experience Gaps**

### **Insights & Recommendations**
- No actionable insights generation
- No next-best-action recommendations
- No coaching recommendations for AEs
- No strategic recommendations for managers

### **Visualization & Formatting**
- Basic text output only
- No emojis or rich formatting
- No structured insights presentation
- No executive summary capabilities

## 6. **Integration Gaps**

### **MCP Integration**
- Basic MCP adapter exists but lacks intelligence features
- No enhanced MCP adapter for intelligence capabilities
- Limited error handling and graceful degradation

### **Permission & Access**
- Missing permission set entries for enhanced classes
- No proper access control for intelligence features

## Priority Recommendations

### **Phase 1: Data Model Enhancement (Critical)**
1. Add missing fields to all three objects
2. Create comprehensive test data
3. Validate data relationships

### **Phase 2: Intelligence Features (High Priority)**
1. Implement renewal risk scoring
2. Add AE performance analysis
3. Create PMF analysis capabilities
4. Build pipeline health scoring

### **Phase 3: Business Logic Enhancement (Medium Priority)**
1. Add opportunity scoring algorithms
2. Implement success rate tracking
3. Create timing optimization logic

### **Phase 4: User Experience (Medium Priority)**
1. Add insights and recommendations
2. Implement rich formatting with emojis
3. Create executive summary capabilities

### **Phase 5: Integration & Testing (Low Priority)**
1. Enhance MCP integration
2. Update permission sets
3. Comprehensive testing and validation

## Success Metrics

### **Data Quality Metrics**
- 100% field completion rate for critical fields
- 150+ test records per object type
- 95% data consistency across objects

### **Intelligence Metrics**
- 95% accuracy in renewal risk scoring
- 90% accuracy in AE performance analysis
